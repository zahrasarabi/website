  abstract  = {This paper presents a framework to understand negation in positive terms.
	Specifically, we extract positive meaning from negation when the negation cue
	syntactically modifies a noun or adjective. Our approach is grounded on
	generating potential positive interpretations automatically, and then scoring
	them. Experimental results show that interpretations scored high can be
	reliably identified.},
